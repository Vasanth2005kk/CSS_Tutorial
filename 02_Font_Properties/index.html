    <h1>1. Read the text thoroughly</h1>
    <p>Read the text several times to ensure you understand everything about the author's message. On the first read, focus simply on reading instead of pausing to take notes. Try to identify the purpose, the supporting argument and any additional details. When you read the text the second time, you can make comments in a notebook or in the margins of the text if you have a physical copy.</p>
    <h1>2. Take notes to identify the main idea</h1>
    <p>Write the main points, themes or thesis you recognize in the text. To identify this concept, try to determine the tone and category of the text. For example, it may be a literary essay or a scientific article. Next, try to find any repetitions in the text. If the author repeats some specific arguments throughout the text, it means they likely are essential. Reading the title and determining the publication place and date can help you learn more about the intended audience.</p>
